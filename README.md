Geoplotlib / geopandas assignment

QUESTION 1) Which are the three cities in BC with the majority of public libraries?

1) most - Vancouver
2) second most - Surrey
3) third most - Langely and Richmond (both have 5)

QUESTION 2) Confirmed with professor that I could use geopandas as opposed to geoplotlib for the choropleth map. The geopandas library does not have the same color palettes (seismic) and tiles (toner-lite). He confirmed I wouldn't get grades reduced for using geopandas. It runs in datascience hub and I added a png for your convenience.

QUESTION 3) Colors do not match perfectly, the ColorMap('jet', alpha=200, levels=20) line would need to be adjusted to be adjusted to match the exact png we were given. I did not know which color palette to use so I just used 'jet'. The code is set correctly to meet all other requirements outlined in the question.
