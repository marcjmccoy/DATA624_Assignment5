Geoplotlib / geopandas assignment

QUESTION 1) Which are the three cities in BC with the majority of public libraries?

1) most - Vancouver
2) second most - Surrey
3) third most - Langely and Richmond (both have 5)

QUESTION 2) Confirmed with professor that I could use geopandas as opposed to geoplotlib for the choropleth map. The geopandas library does not have the same color palettes (seismic) and tiles (toner-lite). He confirmed I wouldn't get grades reduced for using geopandas. It runs in datascience hub and I added a png for your convenience.
